# salesforce-sendgrid-integration
This project integrates SendGrid with Salesforce to provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for sending high-volume emails beyond Salesforce's daily limit of 5,000 emails per day. Using SendGrid enables us to bypass Salesforce's email limits and avoid the high costs associated with purchasing additional email capacity directly from Salesforce.
